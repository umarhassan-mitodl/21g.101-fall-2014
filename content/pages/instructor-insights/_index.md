## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _21G.101 Chinese I (Regular)_ as it was taught by Haohsiang Liao in Fall 2014.

This subject is the first semester of four that forms an introduction to modern standard Chinese. The course presupposes no prior background in the language. The relationship between Chinese language and culture and the sociolinguistically appropriate use of language is stressed throughout the course. Typical class formats include performance of memorized basic conversations, drills, questions and discussion, and various types of communicative exercises.

## Course Outcomes

## Assessment

The students' grades were based on the following activities:

- 60% Daily classroom performance (including performance of basic conversations, participation in class activities, quizzes and/or homework)
- 5% Oral Report
- 25% Review Tests
- 10% Final Oral Interview

### Instructor Insights on Assessment

Grades in the course were largely determined by classroom performance. Among the numerous reasons for this emphasis, the main one is that we are convinced that if students follow the course with consistency and persistence, they will develop significant demonstrable skills in Chinese by the end of the semester.

## Student Information

### Enrollment

About 40 students

### Breakdown by Major

### Typical Student Background

Others are interested in participating in the {{% resource_link "733d4958-72a0-47b5-ae68-8ea83144c5c7" "MIT-China Program" %}} and want to develop their language skills in preparation for an internship or study abroad experience. Others are interested in majoring or minoring in Chinese.
